## questions
1.) should the "Terms Used", "Template Notation", and "Directory Naming"
sections of the README.md file be moved into a separate file?
2.) what should we call `preservation`, `access`, `bookeye-4` methods of digitization? workflows? techniques?  (I'm using "workflow" for now...)
3.) is the `image-set` definition in the README.md file confusing?
4.) are there any suggested changes?
