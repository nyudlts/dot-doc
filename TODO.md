* I will create a separate document for image sets that will be very
  similar to the preservation workflow naming template, but will address
  the digitization of unbound materials, e.g., archival folders, like
  Sylvester Manor, Akkasah, Judson.

* Thank you for this input. I will leave the "terms used" section in the README document.

* add "exploded album" example to image set preservation workflow naming template

* Where "Terms Used" has a bullet point for derivative-maker file
  (dmaker), it says the dmaker file contains a cropped version of the
  master file, but there isn't a master file to crop in the access and
  bookeye workflows. 
  
  Good point! I will change the wording to cover the access and
  bookeye cases.
